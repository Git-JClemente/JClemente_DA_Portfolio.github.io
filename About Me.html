							<p>Hello, I'm Julian. </p>

							<p>	I'm a Data Analyst and Systems Engineer with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from New York University. Since 2015, I've worked as
								an engineer for major defense contractors on the development and design of various large scale projects and programs for the U.S. Navy. </p>
								
							<p> Around mid 2020, I gained interest in the field of big data and invested a couple hundred hours completing a few online courses in my spare time and earning 
								a few certifications in the field (Machine Learning from Stanford University & Google Data Analytics Certificate). Since then, I've continued applying 
								and honing the skills I've picked up, together with the analytical/critical thinking skills as an engineer, to work on and build a data analysis project 
								portfolio of a variety of topics that are relevant or interesting to me. My favorite part about data analytics is being able to communicate a compelling
								but insightful story aided with aesthetically pleasing visualizations to effectively solve business problems.  </p>

							<p> Currently, my goals are to continue building a diverse data analytics project portfolio and make a full career transition from engineering to a data analytics. As a systems engineer, I believe 
								having my system level / big picture perspective as well as my experiences collaborating with cross-functional team, and working closely with stakeholders to analyzing/translating their wants and needs
								into a solution while managing their expectations will help me to be an effective data analyst. As an engineer, I've exemplified strong communication skills as a lead & design review chairperson by
								facilitating stakeholders meetings as well as preparing and presenting technical reports. I am also well-versed in data analytics tools such as SQL, Tableau, R and Python, for data cleaning, 
								processing, analysis and visualization.
